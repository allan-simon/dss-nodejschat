dss-nodejschat
==============

A damn stupid and simple webchat using node.js and its base modules

to launch it simply do

node  server.js  and open 127.0.0.1:8080

The goal of this code was simply to test the basic functionnality of node.js, note for the moment it require jquery+ajax on the server side, but it's should be totally possible to make an even simpler version using a normal form, and writing the message during the page generation
